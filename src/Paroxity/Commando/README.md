<br />

A PocketMine-MP Virion for easier implementation of dynamic commands, including support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition argument listing aimed for both the end users and the plugin developers. <br />

Refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/CortexPE/Commando/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on how to use this virion library.

Poggit CI: [https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/Paroxity/Commando](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/Paroxity/Commando/Commando)

## Differences
- Support infinite depth subcommands (used in [PiggyFactions](https://github.com/DaPigGuy/PiggyFactions))
- Improve error handling for command arguments

We will try to keep this fork up-to-date with the upstream changes.
